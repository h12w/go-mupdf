go-mupdf
========

It is an Go wrapper for MuPDF, automatically generated by cwrap. Only additional
Go extentions are included here.

The generator is under the "examples" directory of cwrap:
https://github.com/hailiang/cwrap

The default output path is $GOPATH/src, so it is suggested that a symlink is
created under $GOPATH/src to link it here.
